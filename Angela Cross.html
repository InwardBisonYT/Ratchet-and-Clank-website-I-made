	<p style="text-align:right;">This is Angela Cross ----></p> 
	<h2 style="text-align:right;">Characteristics:</h2>
	<p style="text-align:right;">Spices: Lombax</p>
	<p style="text-align:right;">Homeworld: Unknown</p>
	<p style="text-align:right;">Currently resides: Planet Grelbin</p>
	<p style="text-align:right;">Gender: Female</p>
	<p style="text-align:right;">Apears in: Ratchet and Clank 2, Ratchet and Clank 3 (Cammio)</p>
	<h3>Apperance:</h3>
	<p>Angela is a female lombax with yellow hair and blue eyes, who is notably taller than Ratchet. She does not have a tail. Though itâ€™s been stated female Lombaxes lack tails, it is unknown why Rivet possesses one and Angela does not. She wears a blue and grey jumpsuit with light turquoise and red accents, as well as a grey belt and grey and red boots.</p>
	<p>As the Unknown Thief, she also wears a dark blue mask with light blue eyes, a red armor covering her chest, and a red cape. Due to her armor and her voice changer, her gender appears more ambiguous as the thief, and most mistake her for male.</p>
	<h4>Personallity:</h4>
	<p>As the Unknown Thief, Angela Cross initially appears to be a morally ambiguous character, working with the Thugs-4-Less and intimidating innocent people to achieve her goals, to the point of robbing a Megacorp store and kidnapping Clank, despite him having no role in Ratchet's mission to apprehend her at the time. She harbored strong resentment for Megacorp, describing their business as "imperialistic eco-fascism".[17]
	When her true intentions were revealed, and she teamed up with Ratchet and Clank, she eventually warmed up to them and became a close friend of both. Angela has strong moral convictions, abandoning a wealthy life with Megacorp to protect the galaxy from the Protopet. Unlike Ratchet and Clank, she gave up quickly on trying to convince Fizzwidget, believing he was senile,[6] though she was not the only employee to share this thought and recognize his behavior has changed.
	Angela is shown to be very smart and resourceful, inventing a gadget capable of curing the Protopet and able to keep in contact with Ratchet and Clank while maintaining a low profile, to the point of using a balloon-o-gram to send a message when she had no other options.[19] However, Angela is also notoriously clumsy, as well as when she was under her thief disguise. She commonly trips over items, even allowing a Protopet to destroy several chemicals shortly after purchasing them. She was also unable to sneak around Snivelak without revealing her location by sneezing.</p>
