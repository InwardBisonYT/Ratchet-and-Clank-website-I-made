	<p>Ratchet and Clank Was the developer Insomniac game's fourth title. With the developer previously working on the massively succsesful Spyro the Dragon Trilogy on the PS1. Unlike Spyro, this game pushed realism and (at the time) pushed the PS2 hardware to its limit. Insomiac had no idea when first developing that game that Ratchet and Clank would become as Iconic as Playstation itself. In this game we are first introduced to our main man Ratchet, who is a lonely Lombax who works as a mechanic on the planet Veldin. He is speculated to be the last remaining Lombax on the universe. Ratchet meets up with Clank, a robitic defect of Dr.Neferiou's Warbot creation facility. The two don't like eachother at first, but by the end they are the best of friends. The Gameplay was a mix of 3D platforming, shooting, puzzle-solving, and even included some RPG mechanics, like the currentcy system Bolts.At the time, there was simply nothing else like it. Despite some camera issues, Ratchet & Clank was well-received upon release, with critics praising its story, tone, and overall originality, and its is amazing how you can go back to this PS2 classic and play it instantly, the game still holds up great to this day. </p>
