	<p>The Ratchet and Clank saga continued in 2003 with the release of Ratchet and Clank 2: Going Comando (heh). This was a direct follow up to 2002's Ratchet and Clank. Developer Insomniac responded to feedback from fans and critics to make on of the best Ratchet and Clank Games of all time. Going Commando was bigger and better than its predecessor in just about every way and benefited from a host of story and gameplay improvements. For one Ratchet's personality was change drastically. In the first game he was selfish and self centered adnd would only help someone if he would get something out of it (what an asshole). There were now racing challenges and weapon advancements with weapons upgradeing and becoming more powerful the more you use them. The story sees the dynamic duo momentarily separated after Ratchet is recruited to become a mercenary for Megacorp. Assigned to track down a thief who stole a biological experiment, Ratchet begins to question Megacorpâ€™s intentions, eventually reuniting with Clank to expose the truth. This game added some gameplay tweaks and quaility of life improvements and is still seen as one of the best Ratchet and Clank games off all time.</p>
