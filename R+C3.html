	<p>Up Your Arsenal is a third person three dimensional action game with elements of platforming, shooting and role playing, in which the player controls Ratchet, a lombax mechanic, with a broad arsenal of weapons and gadgets, who carries his sidekick Clank as a backpack allowing him to make use of the Heli-Pack and Thruster-Pack. For its control scheme, the player can choose the traditional controls under third person, or lock-strafe controls that play more similarly to a third person shooter. Ratchet's arsenal is now able to upgrade weapons up to four times, has expanded and numerated nanotech, and will sometimes operate the turboslider and the hovership. Ratchet and Clank travel between planets in Solana on their ship, the Star Explorer, and must complete a set of objectives to obtain co-ordinates to the next planet to progress the story. Unlike previous entries, not every planet necessarily has a cutscene when its co-ordinates are obtained. Objectives typically require the player to either complete a linear section of a planet, defeating enemies and traversing obstacles along the way, or to participate in a challenge that may involve a minigame.</p>
	<p>After completing the main storyline, the player can choose to warp back to before defeating the final boss to complete remaining side objectives, or to proceed to challenge mode. Challenge mode allows the player to keep their weapons with the option to purchase Mega versions of their weapons, which are then upgradeable twice with use to Giga and Omega weapons, and wield them against much more powerful versions of enemies. As these weapons are much more expensive, challenge mode has a bolt multiplier for enemies that were destroyed before Ratchet takes a hit.</p>
