	<h3>Apperance:</h3>
	<p>Ratchet is a Lombax with yellow fur with two large pointy ears with brown stripes, large hands, flat, triangular clawed feet, and large green eyes. Ratchet's attire normally consists of pants, gloves, a chest harness, and a belt, and sometimes a short-sleeved shirt with boots.  In addition, Ratchet normally equips a wide variety of heavy armor, and wears Clank as a backpack. With some exceptions, the armor does not normally cover his face. </p>
	<h4>Personallity:</h4>
	<p>Ratchet is an eager, headstrong, light-hearted, and astute character. He is a thrillseeker, both having a great sense of adventure and actively enjoying danger. Ratchet's headstrong nature both allows him to fearlessly leap into harm's way, which can be to his benefit or to his detriment depending on his success, particularly when he overestimates his mechanical skills. Ratchet is fairly astute, and though not always able to piece things together immediately, he can notice he is being misled. Ratchet is light-hearted in most situations, often throwing in snide remarks at his foes, or making light jabs at his own expense to brighten the mood. Ratchet's relationships with others have shaped his personal growth and internal struggle. He originally admired Captain Qwark before coming to see him as a fraud, as Qwark was solely motivated by the fame and fortune, something Ratchet has sought himself but resisted selling his integrity for it in a way Qwark would. His relationship with Qwark also showcases his personal growth: Ratchet grew past the focus on vengeance against Qwark in his first adventure, to the point of working closely with Qwark later to help one another out. In addition, Ratchet has resisted harboring similar hatred for his other foes; while Dr. Nefarious loathes Ratchet and wishes to kill him, Ratchet has only ever wanted to stop Nefarious. Ratchet's growth is also seen with Alister Azimuth, a mentor to Ratchet who shared many of the same values, and whose fixation on the promise of using the Great Clock to return the lombaxes mirrored Ratchet's fixation on the Dimensionator for the same purpose. Seeing the damage that could be done to the fabric of space and time by using it, Ratchet warned Azimuth against it, before ultimately fight over it.</p>
