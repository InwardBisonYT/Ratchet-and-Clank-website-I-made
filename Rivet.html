	<h3>Apperance:</h3>
	<p>Rivet is a Lombax with pale white fur with blue stripes on her arm and ears, thin eyebrows, a small pink nose and light blue eyes. She has a pair of googles on her forehead with blue lenses. She has silver hoop earings in ear, two on the right and one on the left. She is seen wareing a black and gray jumpsuit with a belt, an orange scarf, a black left glove with two orange stripes almost at the end, and black boots with an orange detail. She also has a yellow bionic right arm. Unlike the other female Lombax Angela Cross rives has a bushy tail which is similar to her fur, with the white with blue stripes.</p>
	<h4>Personallity:</h4>
	<p>Similar to Ratchet, Rivet is heroc, adventure loving and quick to act. She is prone to craking whity one-liners during tense situations. Rivet is willing to put her life on the line to protect the downtrodden and help those in dire need. However, being a loner has left her socially awkward, skeptical, sour, jaded, and being unacquainted with teamwork. Although after meeting Ratchet, Clank and Kit she manages to become less socially awkward, eventually accsepting Kit as her parntner. She becomes a much happier individual by the end of Rift Apart. She suffers a degree of PTSD becuase she lost her arm during a mission, she lost her arm to one of Dr.Naferious's war bots. This lead to a distaste toward robots. Infact she didn't believe Clank about being for a differant dimention untill she veiwed his memory banks. Similar to Ratchet, Rivet is naturally excited and awed at the prospect of meeting another Lombax. However, upon getting closer to the point of meeting Ratchet, Rivet showed a more clumsy and nervous side, becoming uncomfortable about finally being able to meet another Lombax. Once they do meet, both Rivet and Ratchet felt a little embarrassed in each other's presence but got along well enough quickly, simultaneously saying the same words a few times. Even when they briefly argued when Ratchet accused Rivet of being too scared of Kit while Rivet claimed Ratchet was too scared to find their kind, the two Lombaxes were quick to forgive each other.
	<p>Rivet has become one of the most popular Ratchet and Clank charatcers. And one of my favourite characters</p>
